# About Xhezairbey

> If people cannot write well, they cannot think well, and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them.
<cite>— George Orwell</cite>

I've always found it pretty burdensome to speak about myself. Don't get me wrong, it's not like I can't list a few nice things about me. I do it regularly, even though I never relied on compliments to boost my esteem. I have it in abundance, so much as to pass some onto others. It's just that saying things about oneself – to a degree – feels more awkward when it's done in writing than when spoken.

That said, here's a frail attempt at an icebreaker: I earn a living writing some darn great software; when I wear my unconventional thinker's hat, I write to my exhaustion; I habitually go into seclusion so that I can drown in gratitude, and ponder on how to [become a better human the next day](https://mamiresedje.com). An eccentric yet unapologetically God-fearing and family-loving human.

I have put this website up as a hollow expose of my actions (or rather inactions), and at times, I use it to publicly archive my [thoughts](posts) that may not come by a second time. If I'm in a good mood, I may even share some cool tricks to real-world software solutions.

If you landed here consciously, you'd be forgiven for thinking that I can be of exceptional service. Should you need a gentle refresher, [click here](cv) to see my stripped-down CV, or [here](assets/files/cv.pdf) if you instead prefer a printable, beautifully designed version of it.

Yours faithfully,
